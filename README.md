# README

Welcome to [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com)!

> **Prerequisites**
>
> - Redwood requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (=20.x) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
> - Are you on Windows? For best results, follow our [Windows development setup](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/how-to/windows-development-setup) guide

Start by installing dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Then start the development server:

```
yarn redwood dev
```

Your browser should automatically open to [http://localhost:8910](http://localhost:8910) where you'll see the Welcome Page, which links out to many great resources.

> **The Redwood CLI**
>
> Congratulations on running your first Redwood CLI command! From dev to deploy, the CLI is with you the whole way. And there's quite a few commands at your disposal:
>
> ```
> yarn redwood --help
> ```
>
> For all the details, see the [CLI reference](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/cli-commands).

## Prisma and the database

Redwood wouldn't be a full-stack framework without a database. It all starts with the schema. Open the [`schema.prisma`](api/db/schema.prisma) file in `api/db` and replace the `UserExample` model with the following `Post` model:

```prisma
model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  body      String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
```

Redwood uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), a next-gen Node.js and TypeScript ORM, to talk to the database. Prisma's schema offers a declarative way of defining your app's data models. And Prisma [Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/migrate) uses that schema to make database migrations hassle-free:

```
yarn rw prisma migrate dev

# ...

? Enter a name for the new migration: â€º create posts
```

> `rw` is short for `redwood`

You'll be prompted for the name of your migration. `create posts` will do.

Now let's generate everything we need to perform all the CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) actions on our `Post` model:

```
yarn redwood generate scaffold post
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8910/posts/new](http://localhost:8910/posts/new), fill in the title and body, and click "Save".
